tar -xvf coreutils-8.0.tar.gz
//unzip the file

mkdir coreutils

cd coreutils-8.0

copy and paste the patch from the webpage
//copy the patch

ctrl+o: write out
//write to the patch

enter: confirm the filename
ctrl+x: exit
//exit

patch -pNUM -b -R < backportPatch
//apply the patch to undo what it did

got errors when applying this, therefore creating a back up file because of
the option -b, and a rej file because it failed.

cd src
vi rm.c.rej
//look at the reject file

manually change rm.c taking out lines where it says to take out.

cd ..
make
cd src
touch -oops a b c
./rm *
//check if the patch worked when manually applying it

diff -u rm.c rm.orig > lab4.diff
//create a diff file that contains the differences between the original file
and the file that contains the implementation we desire.
