Most urgent is on top.

#945216 SSH CRC32 attacked detection code contains remote integer oveflow

This is the most urgent because the attacker can execute arbitary code with
the privilges of the SSH daemon, which is typically root. 

#316553 Microsoft Windows TrueType font parsing vulnerability

The second most urgent; the attacker may be able to run arbitary code in
kernel mode; resulting in complete system compromise. The secondary impacts
include, but are not limited to, installation of programs, viewing, changing,
or deleting data; or the creation of new system accounds with full privileges.

#659251 Multiple MIT KRB5 KDC daemon vulnerabilities

The can crash the KDC daemon. Its not as urgent as the first two because they
can't run arbitary code; they can only crash the KDC.

#864643 SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 allow chosen plaintest attack in CBC modes

Allows the attacker to recover potentially sensitive information. Not as urgent
as the first two since they can only recover information. A crash is more 
urgent as it interferes from doing anything where this; the attacker can only
recover information.

#924307 D-Link DIR-685 Xtreme N storage router WPA/WPA2 encryption failure

The attacker can sniff traffic and can use the victim's internet connection
to launch other attacks. Not as serious as the first two because they can't
run arbitary code; or as the crash since they can only look at who is 
connected.
