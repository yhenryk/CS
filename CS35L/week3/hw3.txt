Q1: With the line, it will default to long-iso format if the locales have no
specific format tranlsation. Without it, it will default to 'pox-long-iso' if
the locale setting are messed up.

Q2: Some issues with this patch include:
ISO has been the usual format for 4 years at least, so it might trigger bugs
in scripts parsing ls output. Because ISO is assumed when a format translation
is not available, for ex: en_PH or tl_PH, it gets a ISO format. It will have
different date formats for if applied because the date format is associated 
with the country rather than the langauge. 

Q3: Raises an indexerror because seq is empty. The function random.choice 
takes a random elemeent from a non-empty sequence. However, an emtpy file
will have an empty sequence therefore it raises the error. The argument 
passed into random.choise is self.lines, the lines read from the file. It is
empty because the file is empty.

Q4: When invoking with Python 3, there is an error. There is a syntax error.
This is because Python 3 uses different syntax from Python 2.
