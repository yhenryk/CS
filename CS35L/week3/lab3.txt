wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
//get the tar file to extract 

tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
//extract the file

mkdir coreutilsInstall
//create a temporary directory to hold the executables when installing
cd coreutils-7.6
//go into the folder

./configure --prefix=/home/henry/CS35L/coreutilsInstall
//set the configure so it installs it in this directory.

make

make install
//installs it where we set the destination at with configure.

cd ..
cd coreutilsInstall
//change directory to where it was installed

ls -l /bin/bash
//run the command that will cause the "bug", showing a format that is 
undesirable. 

cd ..

//change directories to where to apply patch

vim NEWS

//ls.o, dir, vdir, ls
ls, vdir, dir were executed under make because they are part of the file ls.
ls.o was also because it is the object file of ls.

vim OLD 
esc :wq
vim old 
esc :wq

touch -t191006072359 -m OLD
./ls -l OLD
./ls -l old

//create test cases, making one at least one year old and then running the ls
command in the src to see if the patch worked. 

//I don't know if this was part of what they wanted, but if the file was 
created on the same year you use ls, then it will display the time instead of
the year.
